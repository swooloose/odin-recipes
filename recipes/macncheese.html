            <li>6 cups milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages shredded American cheese</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) bag potato chips (such as Lay's¬Æ), crushed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>‚Öì cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>butter-flavored cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice. Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.</li>
            <li>Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
