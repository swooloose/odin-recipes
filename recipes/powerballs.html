        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delicious and filling snacks my friend Danielle told me about. I cannot get enough of these! Nothing processed and jam-packed with nutrition. I took these on a 5-hour flight and they kept me satisfied. Also my mom is on a no-processed-food cancer diet and these are a life-saver for the days she doesn't feel well enough to juice and cook! Store bites in the refrigerator or freezer.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup almond butter</li>

                <li>sea salt to taste</li>

            </ul>
